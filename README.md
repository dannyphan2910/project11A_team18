### **WEDABEST:** (Ydalia Molina, Danny Phan, Isabel Tse)

#### **Description:**
DARWIN is our team's minimal viable design of a "Siri" inspired intelligent assistant operated through text-based input. It has 4 main functions as outlined below:

1. Weather 

Inquire about the weather in any city on earth, and DARWIN will tell you the temperature in degrees celsius and give you a future forecast. 

2. Calculator

When your mental math abilities fail you, DARWIN can step in. It has the ability to calculate the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, squared, LCM, GCD, prime number verification.

3. Calendar

Have you ever forgotten what day of the month it is? Or what day of the week? Well, DARWIN's got your back. It can give the user information on the present day, past dates, as well as future dates (in the form of day, month, or year). 

4. Google Search

Have a question that DARWIN does not directly have an answer for? Not a problem at all. The user will be directed to a Google search result link as a lead to the answer.
