#### **_Description:_**
*Ollie* is our team's minimal viable design of a *Siri* inspired intelligent assistant operated through text-based input. Named to reference Brandeis' Ollie the Owl mascot, our product carries the symbolic meaning of wisdom and how this program can help one gain knowledge more efficiently.  It has 4 main functions as outlined below:

*1. Weather*
:earth_asia::sunny::jp::snowflake::us::cyclone::fr::umbrella::uk::snowman::it::zap:

Inquire about the weather in any city on earth, and Ollie will tell you the temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit and give you a future forecast. 

*2. Calculator*
:heavy_plus_sign::heavy_multiplication_x::heavy_division_sign::heavy_check_mark:

When your mental math abilities fail you, Ollie can step in. It has the ability to calculate the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, exponent(power), LCM, GCD, prime number verification, factorials.

*3. Calendar*
:date::hourglass:

Have you ever forgotten what day of the month it is? Or what day of the week? Well, Ollie's got your back. It can give the user information on the present date, past dates, as well as future dates (in the form of day, month, and year). 

*4. Google Search*
:mag::pencil::computer:

Have a question that Ollie does not directly have an answer for? Not a problem at all. The user will be directed to a Google search result link as a lead to the answer.
